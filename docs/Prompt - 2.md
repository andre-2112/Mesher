Using the document "Dev - 1.md", create a script that will:

1 - Automate the execution of all of the mesher.py commands defined in the document.

2 - Run and display (iterate, wiht controls) the results in a 3D viewer - open3d viewer. 

2.1 - in the display window, add 2, side by side sections where on the left we can see and rotate/orb the point cloud and on the right, we can see the generated mesh. maybe add a menu bar wiht a drop down to select the meshing method to be displayed and another drop down for the export format.
